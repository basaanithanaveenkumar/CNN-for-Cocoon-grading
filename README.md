## Quality
Quality is the main term applicable to any selling object.It is defined as the ,measure of excellence or the state of being free from defects and defeciencies.Superior cocoon quality can be brought about by the strict
and consistent adherence to measurable and verifiable standards. The cocoon output achieved should satisfy the silk reeling requirements.It has been established that cocoon quality contributes to the tune of about 80 per cent of the raw silk quality. Cocoon quality is governed by several parameters, each of them has importance at certain level. Some of the important quality parameters usually considered are Shell percentage, Defective Cocoon Percentage, Average Filament Length,Average Non Broken Filament Length, Denier, and Reelability percentage. Of these, Shell percentage and Defective Cocoon percentage have been identified as the most significant ones especially because these are relatively easy to determine. lt has been established that each of the quality parameters has its own relative significance on the reeling efficiency and raw silk quality.

# Classification of defective coooons
When cocoons are sold at the market, price is assessed on the basis of cocoon quality. This is judged by grading
shell percentage and the percentage of defective cocoons. lf the percentage of defective cocoons is high, the price will be less.Therefore tit is necessary to know different kindsof defective cocoonsand ways and means to avoid their
occurrence. An account of defective cocoons is given under.
# lnside Stained/Melt cocoons
Dead cocoons are also known as melted cocoons. ln this case, the pupa is dead and sticks to the inside shell of the cocoon causing a stain. Melted cocoons are called mutes because they do not make a sound when shaken. These cocoons are difficult to process and will result in silk which is dull in colour.
# Outside stained cocoons (dead cocoons)
These are recognized by a rusty colour spot on the cocoon shell caused by absorption of intestinal fluid/urine of the mature worm formed during mounting. Reelability is very poor in this case.
# Montage pressed cocoons
this is the defect happens due to improper mounting frames.they are also callled as scaffold presses cocoons
# Deformed cocoons
these are abnormally shaped cocoons.this defect may be due to racial characteristics
# Flimsy cocoons
the shell is lossly spun in layers and has a low silk content.These cocoons are produceing wastes and easily overcooked
# Thin end cocoons
One or both the ends of the cocoons are thin and there is a risk of bursting when processed .the cause of tis defect may be attributed to racial characteristics or impropper temperature and humdity during rearing and mounting.
